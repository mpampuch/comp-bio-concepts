## Cutting a seam

Below is a function called `remove_in_each_row(img, pixels)`. It takes a matrix `img` and a vector of integers, `pixels`, and shrinks the image by 1 pixel in width by removing the element `img[i, pixels[i]]` in every row. This function is one of the building blocks of the Image Seam algorithm we saw in the lecture.

Read it and convince yourself that it is correct.

## **Exercise 1** - _Building up to dynamic programming_

In this exercise and the following ones, we will use the computational problem of Seam carving. We will think through all the "gut reaction" solutions, and then finally end up with the dynamic programming solution that we saw in the lecture.

In the process we will understand the performance and accuracy of each iteration of our solution.

### How to implement the solutions:

For every variation of the algorithm, your job is to write a function which takes a matrix of energies, and an index for a pixel on the first row, and computes a "seam" starting at that pixel.

The function should return a vector of as many integers as there are rows in the input matrix where each number points out a pixel to delete from the corresponding row. (it acts as the input to `remove_in_each_row`).

#### Exercise 1.2 - _Recursion_

A common pattern in algorithm design is the idea of solving a problem as the combination of solutions to subproblems.

The classic example, is a [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) generator.

The recursive implementation of Fibonacci looks something like this
"""

# ╔═╡ 32e9a944-f3b6-11ea-0e82-1dff6c2eef8d
md"""
Notice that you can call a function from within itself which may call itself and so on until a base case is reached. Then the program will combine the result from the base case up to the final result.

In the case of the Fibonacci function, we added the solutions to the subproblems `fib(n-1)`, `fib(n-2)` to produce `fib(n)`.

An analogy can be drawn to the process of mathematical induction in mathematics. And as with mathematical induction there are parts to constructing such a recursive algorithm:

- Defining a base case
- Defining an recursion i.e. finding a solution to the problem as a combination of solutions to smaller problems.

1. For each pixel (i, j) in row i, the algorithm calls itself recursively for all valid pixels in the next row (j-1, j, j+1). Then for each of those pixels, it recursively repeats the same process for the row below. This continues until it reaches the bottom row (i == m). That means: every possible path from the starting pixel down to the bottom is explored.

2. The image is m × n. A seam starts somewhere in the top row (n choices) At each next row, it can move straight down (Δj = 0), down-left (Δj = -1), or down-right (Δj = +1). So at most 3 choices per row. 
	
- Growth is linear in $n$. 
- Growth is exponential in $m$ 
	
The number of possible seams is: 

$O(n \cdot 3^m)$

That’s why seam carving is normally implemented using dynamic programming, which reduces it to:

$O(mn)$

**Memoization** is the name given to the technique of storing results to expensive function calls that will be accessed more than once.

As stated in the video, the function `least_energy` is called repeatedly with the same arguments. In fact, we call it on the order of $3^n$ times, when there are only really $m \times n$ unique ways to call it!

Lets implement memoization on this function with first a [dictionary](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Dictionaries) for storage.

#### Exercise 2.1 - _Dictionary as storage_

Let's make a memoized version of least_energy function which takes a dictionary and
first checks to see if the dictionary contains the key (i,j) if it does, returns the value stored in that place, if not, will compute it, and store it in the dictionary at key (i, j) and return the value it computed.


`memoized_least_energy(energies, starting_pixel, memory)`

This function must recursively call itself, and pass the same `memory` object it received as an argument.

You are expected to read and understand the [documentation on dictionaries](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Dictionaries) to find out how to:

1. Create a dictionary
2. Check if a key is stored in the dictionary
3. Access contents of the dictionary by a key.

### Exercise 2.2 - _Matrix as storage_ (optional)

The dictionary-based memoization we tried above works well in general as there is no restriction on what type of keys can be used.

But in our particular case, we can use a matrix as a storage, since a matrix is naturally keyed by two integers.

👉 Write a variant of `matrix_memoized_least_energy` and `matrix_memoized_seam` which use a matrix as storage.
